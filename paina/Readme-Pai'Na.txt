 Pai'Na NPC Mod for BG2:EE by Artemius_I
---------------------------------------

-----------------------
 Introduction & Details
-----------------------

This mod makes Pai'Na, the true neutral half-drow hivemaster druid in the Graveyard tombs, a playable NPC with banters and interjections. She has a unique hivemaster kit.

	STR: 10
	DEX: 18
	CON: 15
	INT: 14
	WIS: 16
	CHA: 15
	Total: 88

Vanilla Pai'Na stats:
	STR: 14
	DEX: 18
	CON: 13
	INT: 13
	WIS: 15
	CHA: 15

I shifted her stats around to favor a pureclass druid but kept the total the same.

She has one banter with every NPC in SoA and a few talks with the PC. She may fight Viconia, but a sufficiently charismatic PC can prevent it if he/she so wishes.

 Hivemaster Kit
-----------------------

HIVEMASTER: The Hivemaster is a druid that focuses on fostering and protecting insects and arachnids, including giant versions thereof. Most commonly stylise themselves after either communal insects, such as ants or bees (hence the name), or predators like spiders, scorpions and dragonflies.

Advantages:
 - Immunity to poison.
 - May cast Web once per day.
 - May shapeshift into a huge spider once per day.
 - Level 5: May cast Spider Spawn once per day.
 - Level 8: May shapeshift into a sword spider once per day.
 - Level 14: May shapeshift into a wraith spider once per day.

Disadvantages:
 - May not shapeshift into default animal forms.

 Widow's Kiss
-----------------------
This obsidian ring is quite large and embedded with a large spider-shaped gemstone. It is Pai'Na's most (and only) treasured possession and she refuses to even remove it.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- Once per day, may summon a swarm of 12 spiders under Pai'Na's control. The spiders are weak but have a powerful poison and can be extremely dangerous in a group.

Equipped abilities:
– Can memorize one extra divine spell of each level

 FAQ
-----------------------
Q: Voicing?
A: No.

Q: Hey, she feels really out of character!
A: She might, but having three lines for the vanilla game isn't much character to go on. I wrote her in the way I found appealing. I did not take the UB writing into account, because I really could not maintain that character.

Q: What parties does she fit in?
A: All sorts. She doesn't particularly like any NPC over another, except for Viconia, who she hates.

Q: Why does she fight with Viconia?
A: She despises drow. You can stop them with a Charisma of 15 or above. Go pick up the Ring of Human Influence.

Q: Isn't she a bit overpowered?
A: Maybe. I always felt druids tapered off with level so she'll at most keep up with your other characters, but she certainly is a step up from Cernd and maybe even Jaheira. She won't break the game's difficulty, that's for certain. Be thankful I didn't keep her vanilla 50% magic resistance.

Q: Any personal quests?
A: No.

Q: Romance?
A: At the moment, no.

Q: Is this mod compatible with Unfinished Business?
A: Unfortunately, not yet. This mod overrides Pai'Na's dialogue and character, so you won't be able to get the Spider's Bane quest.
