REPLACE ~99999~ ~After completing her journey with <CHARNAME>, Pai'Na returned to her sanctuary in Athkatla and discovered, to her horror, its destruction by the vermin extermination crew of Athkatla. Enraged by the sight of her former home burned down, the half-drow swore revenge against the civilized folk of the city, and soon rumors of many underground workers disappearing in the depths of the sewers spread throughout the city. Though the government initially dismissed such tales, the increasing dangers of the sewers and tombs forced them into action. Soldiers were sent down to the sewers of Athkatla only to discover that the entire underground system was taken over by spiders, webs and cocoons entangling the pipes and walls wherever they looked. As they cut through the webs in their way, a swarm of massive black spiders emerged from the darkness, and it is said that all of Athkatla heard the anguished screams from below. For many years to come, the underground of Athkatla became an uninhabitable home for arachnids where any man who trespassed never returned.~

REPLACE ~99999~ ~After completing her journey with <CHARNAME>, Pai'Na returned to her sanctuary in Athkatla and discovered, to her horror, its destruction by the vermin extermination crew of Athkatla. Though enraged by the sight of her former home burned down, she chose to rebuild rather than seek revenge, using her great power to create a far better shelter for her spiders that would protect them from danger before leaving Athkatla entirely. She returned to her former home in the Forest of Tethir, and although the forest witch that fostered her was long gone, she built a home for herself and her arachnid family within a magical glade. Her experiences with <CHARNAME> had given her greater wisdom, and she chose to become a guardian of not only her own charges, but all creatures that called the forest home. Pai'Na eventually discovered during her research into hivemaster rituals that the potion she had drunk to gain greater power had shortened her lifespan greatly as a consequence despite her success, but she accepted her impending death without fear, finding peace with the knowledge that she would have a few more years to live in peace. She spent the remaining years of her life in quiet contemplation.~

She chose to make the best of the many years that were ahead of her, creating a sanctuary where her wild friends could live in safety and harmony.~

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- Once per day, may summon a swarm of 12 spiders under Pai'Na's control. The spiders are weak but have a deadly poison and can be extremely dangerous in a group.

Equipped abilities:
- Can memorize one extra divine spell of each level~

SAY NAME2 ~Kitthix Figurine~
SAY DESC ~This black spider figurine fits in the palm of your hand. When the command word is spoken, the figurine comes to life as a semi-intelligent spider called Kitthix. The huge spider will obey its master's commands for the duration of the spell or until slain. After eight hours, regardless of whether the spider lived or died, the figurine returns. It takes a day to recharge the figurine.

Pai'Na has enhanced the power of Kitthix with hivemaster magic. The figurine now has a blood-red tint, as does the spider itself.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
- Summon Kitthix once per day
  Range: 20 ft.
  Duration: 8 hours
  The spider can phase during combat. It can also use its Web Tangle ability, which sprays a stream of webbing at one target. If the target fails its Save vs. Spell at -2, it will be held by the webbing for 2 rounds. Kitthix's melee attack inflicts 1d10 damage (piercing), occurs 3/2 times per round, and is poisonous (Save vs. Poison at +1 negates). Additionally, Kitthix regenerates for 1 hp/round and may cast Horror and Vampiric Touch twice per summoning.

SAY DESC ~This murky potion is a deadly mixture composed primarily of the venom of a bebilith, a demonic spider. The magic used in its creation was meant to grant its drinker power... supposing that they survive the process. It was created by the spider witch for Pai'Na's final test, but was taken away from her out of concern for her life. She may attempt to take the test now... though the danger is likely severe, and she will either gain massive power or die an agonizing death.

STATISTICS:

Grants immense druidic power to the imbiber, albeit at a massive cost to their health. There is a chance that the imbiber will die permanently.
Duration: Permanent
